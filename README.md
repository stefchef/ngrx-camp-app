# Pizza

The target of this project was to get a basic knowledge of ngrx and angular 4.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to be able to use and feel confortable with the below mentioned technologies in a project.

### Used technologies:
* Html
* Typescript
* SASS - Was used with angular material. Not much of the sass features were actually used.
* Angular 4
* Angular 4 CLI - Used for generation of component / modules and to run and build the application
* Angular 4 Material - Googles UI design was used for input fields / layouts / navigation and the whole application styling.
* ngrx - State handling and overall application architecture. Used with store and effects.

### Not used technologies but planned
* ngrx forms - ngrx forms is a library which helps binding the formvalues to the store. Sadly ngrx forms is based on a different version of ngrx than the version we used.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
